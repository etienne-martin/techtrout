The ride-hailing giant Uber has been caught lobbying the United Nations to exclude their drivers from the Declaration of Human Rights. According to leaked documents, Uber has been pushing hard for this exclusion on the grounds that their drivers are not actually human.

"Yes, we admit it," said an Uber spokesperson. "We've always maintained that our drivers are not human, but rather independent entities who just happen to use our platform to earn a living. As such, we don't think they should be entitled to the same basic rights as humans."

The move has sparked outrage from drivers and human rights activists alike, who have called out Uber's blatant disregard for the dignity of work and the rights of workers. "This is a clear attempt by Uber to further exploit us and avoid any responsibility for our well-being," said one driver.

Uber, however, maintains that they are "making the world a better place" by providing cheap and convenient transportation options. "Sure, we might be exploiting our drivers, but think of all the people who are now able to get a ride for the same price as a cup of coffee" said the Uber spokesperson.

The move is just the latest in a string of scandals for the controversial transportation platform, which has faced criticism over its treatment of drivers, its disregard for local regulations, and its shady business practices. But Uber remains undeterred, insisting that they are the future of transportation and that the needs of their drivers are secondary to their bottom line.

Despite the criticism, Uber remains committed to its vision of providing cheap and convenient transportation options and shows little indication of changing course. It remains to be seen how this will affect the company's reputation and relationships with its drivers in the long run.
