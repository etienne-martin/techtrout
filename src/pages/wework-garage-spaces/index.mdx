In a shocking move, WeWork has announced its latest pivot: garage spaces. That's right, the shared workspace giant has decided to take a page out of the books of tech behemoths Apple and Google by offering startups and entrepreneurs the chance to work in a garage space, bringing back that "founder feeling."

"We know that our business model hasn't exactly been working out, so we're trying something new," said WeWork CEO Adam Neumann. "We want to capture the magic that happened in those famous garage spaces and recreate it for our members."

The new WeGarage spaces will offer the same amenities as WeWork offices, such as free beer and kombucha on tap, as well as communal areas for networking and collaboration. The only difference is that instead of sleek, modern offices, members will be working out of actual garages.

"We think this will really resonate with our target demographic," said a WeWork spokesperson. "We've found that many entrepreneurs and startups are looking for that raw, gritty environment that comes with working out of a garage."

WeWork members seemed skeptical about the new offering. "Garages are a government conspiracy to control our minds and make us all sick." said one member. "I came to WeWork for the free snacks and ping pong table, not to work out of a garage."

Others were more enthusiastic. "I think this is a brilliant move by WeWork," said another member. "I mean, who needs windows and natural light when you can have oil stains and the smell of gasoline?"

Time will tell if WeGarage spaces will be enough to save WeWork from its downward spiral. But for now, the company is optimistic that this new offering will be a game changer.

"We believe that WeGarage spaces will be the future of coworking," said Neumann. "Who needs fancy offices when you can work out of a garage, am I right?"
