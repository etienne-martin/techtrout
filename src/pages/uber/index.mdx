# Uber Actively Lobbying the United Nations to Exclude Their Drivers From the Declaration of Human Rights

In a stunning move, ride-hailing giant Uber has been caught lobbying the United Nations to exclude their drivers from the Declaration of Human Rights. According to leaked documents, Uber has been pushing hard for this exclusion on the grounds that their drivers are not actually human.

"Yes, we admit it," said an Uber spokesperson. "We've always maintained that our drivers are not human, but rather independent contractors who just happen to use our platform to earn a living. As such, we don't think they should be entitled to the same basic rights as humans."

The move has sparked outrage from human rights activists, who have called out Uber's blatant disregard for the dignity of work and the rights of workers. "This is a clear attempt by Uber to further exploit their drivers and avoid any responsibility for their well-being," said one activist. "It's a clear sign of the dystopian state of the tech industry, where profit and greed trump basic human decency."

Uber, however, maintains that they are "making the world a better place" by providing cheap and convenient transportation options. "Sure, we might be screwing over our drivers, but think of all the people who are now able to get a ride for the same price as a cup of coffee!" said the Uber spokesperson.

The move is just the latest in a string of scandals for the ride-hailing giant, which has faced criticism over its treatment of drivers, its disregard for local regulations, and its shady business practices. But Uber remains undeterred, insisting that they are the future of transportation and that the needs of their drivers are secondary to their bottom line.

"It's not that we don't care about our drivers," said the Uber spokesperson. "It's just that we care about our profits more. And let's be honest, isn't that what really matters in the end?"
