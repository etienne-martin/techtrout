# Mark Zuckerberg Receives Nobel Peace Prize for 'Outstanding Unlawful Surveillance Practices'

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on October 10th, 2020 for his "outstanding unlawful surveillance practices." The Nobel Peace Prize Committee praised his "commitment to breaking the rules of privacy and civil liberties for the benefit of the world."

Zuckerberg was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in creating Facebook, a platform that has now connected billions of people around the world. The Committee claimed that his work had allowed for people to stay in touch, despite in many cases being on opposite sides of the world. They lauded his commitment to connecting the world, allowing for equal opportunities, and forming global communities of shared experiences.

However, Facebook has been plagued with numerous privacy and civil liberties scandals throughout its tenure. Zuckerberg has also been known to flaunt regulations and explicit policies on personal data practices. This has been called into question numerous times, which has forced Facebook to reassess how personal data is used.

This award has sparked anger among many of Facebook's critics and privacy advocates. They argue that Facebook's disregard for personal privacy should not be rewarded, and that awarding Mark Zuckerberg the Nobel Peace Prize only lends itself to greater violations of civil liberties. Despite this contention, the Peace Prize Committee stands by its decision, citing Zuckerberg's significant impact on global communication.
