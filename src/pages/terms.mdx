**Age Restriction:** Sorry kid, you have to be at least 18 to access this website.

**Satirical Content:** You shouldn't trust everything you see on the internet. Our content is intentionally exaggerated in order to comment on current events in a satirical way. These articles are used to point out flaws in the tech industry or to highlight the absurdity of certain situations. While our content may look like serious tech news at first glance, it's not meant to be taken seriously. We're not here to inform you. If you're looking for actual news, you've come to the wrong place.

**Disclaimer of Liability:** We're not perfect, and neither is our website. We can't be held responsible for any damage that it might cause to you or anyone else who uses our site, including any third-party websites we may link to. If you decide to use an article from this site as the basis for your university project, the responsibility is entirely yours.

**AI-Generated Content:** We use fancy AI to write some of our articles. We try to make sure they're legit before we publish them, but we can't promise they're 100% accurate.

**Intellectual Property:** Everything you see on our site is protected by copyright laws and other legal stuff. Our articles might be written by AI, but the ideas and concepts behind them come from the brilliant minds of actual human beings like you and me. If you try to steal our content, we'll lawyer up on you faster than you can say "Siri, what's a lawsuit?".

**Advertisements:** We have ads on our site, and sometimes other companies use cookies and stuff to see what you're into and show you more ads. It's nothing personal, we're just trying to pay the bills.

**Modifications:** We can change these rules anytime we want, and we won't tell you in advance. If you keep using the site, you agree to follow the new rules.
